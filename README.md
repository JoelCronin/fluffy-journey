# Employee Tree Generator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-green)

In this project, I was approached to write a set of code that would allow users to quickly generate a HTML employee tree based on the responses they provided over the Inquirer NPM package. I would also have to use "Jest" to implement a robust set of tests for the code to pass. In this taks I used new concepts such as javascript super and sub classes as well as Test Driven Development (TDD) and found it to be an enjoyable project.
